<h4>1.0 DEFINITIONS OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY </h4>
<p>
    1.1 CHEATING
    San José State University defines cheating as the act of obtaining credit, attempting to obtain credit, or assisting others to obtain credit for academic work through the use of any dishonest, deceptive, or fraudulent means. Cheating includes:
    <br />
    1.1.1. Copying, in part or in whole, from another’s test or other evaluation instrument, including homework assignments, worksheets, lab reports, essays, summaries, and quizzes;
    <br />
    1.1.2. Submitting work previously graded in another course without prior approval by the
    course instructor or by departmental policy;
    <br />
    1.1.3. Submitting work simultaneously presented in two or more courses without prior approval
    by all course instructors or by the department policies of all departments;
    1.1.4. Using or consulting sources, tools or materials prohibited by the instructor prior to, or
    during an examination;
    <br />
    1.1.5. Altering or interfering with the grading process;
    <br />
    1.1.6. Sitting for an examination by a surrogate or as a surrogate;
    <br />
    1.1.7. Any other act committed by a student in the course of their academic work that defrauds
    or misrepresents, including aiding others in any of the actions defined above.
    <br />

<p>
    Pledge<br />
    I have read and understand the university definition of cheating and plagiarism.
    <br />
    I will not copy (“cut and paste”) or paraphrase (rewrite without changing the essential meaning) any
    material from any source without proper attribution.
    <br />
    I will not discuss any assignment that is part of the course grade with anybody without prior approval from the instructor.
    <br />
    I understand that there is no make-up opportunity for assignments where breaches of academic integrity have occurred.
    <br />
    I understand that breaches of academic integrity will result in the reporting of the incident to the university office of Student Conduct & Ethical Development, will result in academic sanctions, as well as possible administrative sanctions, in accordance to the university policy F15-7.
    <br />
    I will ask the instructor for guidance if I have any questions or am uncertain about how the above is to be understood.
    <br />
    I understand that such a request for guidance is legitimate and will not in any way reflect badly on me or my academic standing.
